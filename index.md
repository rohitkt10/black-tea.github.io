## Welcome!

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_photo_square.jpg">

I am a transportation planner and researcher based in Los Angeles, California. 

I've been fortunate enough to work on and study a variety of different topics within transportation, including the famous 'Carmageddon,' Los Angeles' innovative ExpressPark program, and the Vision Zero traffic safety initiative. In my spare time, I've undertaken other fun transportation-related projects, such as the Los Angeles Bus Map.
